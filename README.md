Slides on machine learning, TensorFlow, research, MLOps and everything else I'm interested in

## What is it?
I am sharing some slides that I presented at public events. Each directory contains a `main.md` file that you can easily edit and compile [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to any format that you wish. See how in the [excelent tutorial by Peter Conrad here](https://stymied.medium.com/what-slides-from-markdown-5239ed31e7ac).

## TODO
- [ ] Add a table of contents to README and list the place of presentation of each slide.

## Disclaimers
- Most of the slides here are in English, but you may find some in Turkish. I will try to translate them into English at my spare time.
- I'll try to keep this repo up-to-date as much as possible, but this may not simply be possible all the time. Pay attention to the date of publishing and be aware that things may have changed.

## Contributing
You can always make additions to the slides here with pull requests, or request clarifications in issues.
